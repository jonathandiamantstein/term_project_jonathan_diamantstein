First Part: Dowloading Packages and Required Data

from donee montreal download comptage.csv data, REV.geojson data, Bike network data, bixi.geojson data

as well import these packages; import requests, import geopandas as gpd, import pandas as pd , import json, import folium, from shapely.geometry import LineString, and from shapely.geometry import Point

Second Part: Summing reqruied Bike counter data

The conversation started with a question about how to sum column values from a CSV file named Bike_counts.csv and add them to a new dataset with the column IDs as headers. The solution involved using the pandas library to read the CSV file, summing the columns individually, creating a new dataframe with the sums as column values and column IDs as headers, and saving the new dataframe as a CSV file.

The next question was about removing the compteur_ prefix from the IDs in the dataset. The solution was to use the str method to remove the prefix from the column names.

The conversation then shifted to merging the df dataset and bike_count_location together based on the "ID" column and creating a geometry field out of the "x" and "y" columns. The solution involved using the pandas and geopandas libraries to read in the datasets, merging them based on the "ID" column, and creating a GeoDataFrame with a Point geometry column from the "x" and "y" columns.

The next question was about mapping the Montreal bike paths instead of the Bixi stations. The solution involved reading in the Montreal bike paths from a GeoJSON file using the geopandas library and adding them to a Folium map object along with the bike count locations from the merged dataset.

The next task was to create a function that creates new bike paths based on proximity to high "sums" in the merged dataset. The solution involved using the geopandas library to create a buffer around the bike count locations and finding the bike paths that intersected with the buffer. The new bike paths were then created by connecting the bike paths that were close in proximity but not intersecting, and the bike paths that were connected by high bike counters from the merged dataset.

Finally, there was a question about converting a gdf.csv file into a GeoJSON file. The solution involved using the pandas and geopandas libraries to read in the CSV file, create a GeoDataFrame with a Point geometry column from the longitude and latitude columns, and saving the GeoDataFrame as a GeoJSON file using the to_file method.

Third Part: finding Highest Bike Counter Stations

We then load the data from a CSV file named 'gdf.csv' using the read_csv() function of pandas.

Next, we group the data by the 'Nom' column using the groupby() function of pandas. The groupby() function groups the rows of the data frame based on the unique values in the specified column, in this case, the 'Nom' column.

After grouping the data by 'Nom', we sum the values in the 'sums' column using the sum() function of pandas.

We then sort the grouped data in descending order based on the sum of 'sums' column using the sort_values() function of pandas. The sort_values() function sorts the data frame in ascending or descending order based on the values of the specified column.

Finally, we select the top 5 results using the head() function of pandas and print them using the print() function of Python.

In summary, the first method involves grouping the data by 'Nom', summing the values in the 'sums' column for each group, sorting the grouped data in descending order based on the sum of 'sums' column, selecting the top 5 results, and printing them.

Fourth: Mapping data

3 maps are created, the first being summed bike count data with exisitng infrastructure, the second is rev infrastructure and summed bike count data, and the third is bixi data and exisitng bike networks.

Fifth Part: Building tool

the goal was to create a function that fills in gaps between bike paths in close proximity to one another, and then display the result in a folium map. The fill_bike_path_gaps function was created for this purpose, which takes three parameters: the filename of the bike paths to be filled, a buffer distance to create a buffer around each bike path, and a tolerance value to simplify the buffer polygon.

The function first reads in the bike paths from the specified file using the geopandas.read_file() method. It then creates a buffer around each bike path using the buffer() method with the specified buffer distance, and dissolves the resulting polygons into a single MultiPolygon using the unary_union() method. The dissolved buffer is then simplified using the simplify() method with the specified tolerance value.

Next, the function explodes the simplified buffer into its constituent polygons using the explode() method, and then applies the interiors property to each polygon to get the interior rings. It then creates a new Polygon using the exterior property of the first polygon and the interior rings of the remaining polygons, and adds it to a list of polygons.

Finally, the function creates a new GeoDataFrame from the list of polygons, with a single row containing the new bike path geometry. The resulting GeoDataFrame is returned by the function.

To display the new bike path in a folium map, the function is called with the desired parameters, and the resulting GeoDataFrame is used to create a Folium GeoJSON layer, which is added to a new folium map centered on Montreal.

unfortunetly the function didnt work but i tried...
